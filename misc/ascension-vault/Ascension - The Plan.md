Stuff that needs done:

**Level Design**
- Introduce platforming
- Introduce hazards and enemies slowly
- Have a main path and lots of little side paths and forks?
- Hidden chests/secrets?

- The story/design is about ascension from the bottom of a cave up to the surface

**Mechanics**
 - I want to be able to spend a lot of time getting the character controller feeling nice.

**Story Design**
 - For now, don't need to do much.

**Art**
 -

## Eventually

**Equipment**
 - 2 types of weapons, 2-3 of each type.
 - 1 type of armor (eventually 2), 3-4 of each type?

**Enemies**
 - Themed based on the world that they are in
 - Small chance to drop weapons or armor? Have enemy themed armor pieces?
